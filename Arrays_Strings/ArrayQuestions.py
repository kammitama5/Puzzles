"""
1.
Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all 
unique characters
"""

"""
2.
Write code to reverse a C-style string.
"""

"""
3.
Design an algorithm to write code to remove the duplicate
characters in a string without using any additional buffer.
Note: One or two of the additional variables are fine.
An extra copy of the array is not.
Write the test cases for this method 
"""

"""
4.
Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not 
"""

"""
5.
Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'
"""

"""
6.
Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, 
its entire row and column is set to 0
"""

"""
7.
Assume you have a method isSubString which checks if one word 
is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write 
code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to 
to isSubstring (ie waterbottle is a rotation of erbottlewat)
